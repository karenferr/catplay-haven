# CatPlay Haven

# About
This repository hosts a small practice project featuring a storefront for a fictional cat playgrounds shop. It is part of my journey to enhance my front-end web development skills. The main goal was to design and develop a responsive web page using only HTML and CSS. This project uniquely showcases a range of cat playground products, where each product image has been creatively generated using AI technology.
