# About
This repository hosts a small practice project featuring a storefront for a fictional cat playgrounds shop. It is part of my journey to enhance my front-end web development skills. The main goal was to design and develop a responsive web page using only HTML and CSS. This project uniquely showcases a range of cat playground products, where each product image has been creatively generated using AI technology.

## Technologies 
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Learnings
- Implementing Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Incorporating AI-generated imagery to enrich the visual appeal of web design

## Features
- A product page that displays a variety of cat playgrounds
- Responsively designed components that adapt to different screen sizes
- Interactive elements like hover effects on buttons and links

Feel free to explore the code and see how AI-generated images can be integrated into a web development project!
